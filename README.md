# Project React Native App ðŸ“±
This project is a first dive in to the world of React Native, exploring navigation, sensors and styling.

## The problem

My project started out quite simple, with just a fetch of an API from Marvel and displaying some comics. Then I incoporated React Navigation using drawer navigator and later also stack navigator. This, together with styled components, was very interesting but also a bit of a challange to get into. I ended up using drawer navigation as my main menu and stack navigaton as a nested navigation for the game-part of the App.
I also added some animation with react animated. I found this to be the hardest part to build from scratch, so I ended up using others code with a bit of modification. Using this to display the different comics in a slide show on the phone made it much improved from just a normal scroll down view.
Much of the end of this weeks project went to doing my game where I use the Accelerometer and using this, the user get's to choose a hero and attacks an enemy by shakig the phone. The game is very random, but atleast the characters have some modified hitpoints and attackdamage to make it a bit more interesting.

If I had more time I would do so much more with this. I see much potential in these techniques.
